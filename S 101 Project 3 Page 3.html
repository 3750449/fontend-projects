    <h1>Future of Technology and Society</h1>
    <p>The future holds immense potential for technological advancement. Here are some key areas to watch...

        When it comes to the role of how technology plays in our modern era, how we chose to use it greatly affects how we allow it to grow as a whole in the future. 
        Ever since the deployment of the first commercial-ready personal computer (PC), computer users all over the world have contributed to the expansion of what could be made possible with computer technology. 
        This can be expressed in many different ways. From solving complex math equations to increasing what the human eye can see, the level of what we are capable of achieving has more than doubled over the last decade. 
        As our country’s infrastructure improves we can expand our availability to provide service for electronic devices and our overall internet coverage. 
        Our need to expand our infrastructure is crucially important to how well we can improve and adapt our environment to the ever-increasing need for consumer electronics and the reduction of hazardous product waste. 
        So to combat this problem we have started to increase the furthering of our scientific fields to allow for better technological development. 
        Furthermore, with developments in the fields of computer science, we have become capable of bringing the applications of computer technology to the majority of our population. 
        With this in mind, there are many different ways people and consumers of electronics have been able to learn and use devices with previously had been priced in the thousands. 
        Instead of just big business or corporations being the only ones able to possess and work with electronic devices like desktop computers, electronic printers, and other high-end devices; the development of cheaper public consumer-based electronics have allowed users to have access to an array of services like Cloud computing, Long-distance communications, Cybersecurity, Data management, and Software development to name a few. 
        To be more specific, when looking at those services more closely they naturally fall under the technological term of information technology and their main purpose is to help expand the amount of information that one can ascertain from a given medium. 
        With the benefits of information technology, people can store, communicate, protect, arrange or manage and create new forms of information from preexisting or ascertained information. 
        In simpler terms, gathered information can be almost rearranged and used in any way a user sees fit. 
        But these technological advancements come with a downside of the need for large sums of capital to fuel their creation. 
        So like all economic opportunities, businesses work to find ways of making said technological achievements not only viable but to allow for a more steady deployment of services in our social economy. 
        This payout is one of the things that drive innovation in our modern industrial society and allows for unique products to generate considerable interest in the facilitation of innovation methods. 
        So when considering what economic opportunity could poise a significant impact on our society, one of the information technologies that come to mind is Cloud computing. 
        Cloud computing is one of the newer technological advancements to hit the electronic market in recent years and has already shown significant growth. 
        Cloud computing is an online service that allows consumers to store and access data resources via an internet connection. 
        The purpose of using cloud computing is to help solves and reduce the many storage and security problems created by using local server storage. 
        Additionally, this allows for a monetary saving of capital expense since consumers only pay for using the “cloud space”. 
        In a technologically modern society, Cloud Computing allows consumers to avoid the costs of labor and natural overhead problems like managing server uptake, hiring onsite and cyber security, protecting server data through data recovery, and onsite/offsite backups of clients data storage. 
        In the world of modern business, cloud computing has opened up opportunities that have not been previously afforded to the working world before. 
        Employees can now work together more efficiently from different locations all over the world with little need for them to personally store and forward each piece of information by hand; as well as minor and/or tedious tasks can be offset to a cloud computing service instead. 
        Cloud services integrate client devices and remove obstacles like the time and distance between accessing their information. 
        When looking at cloud computing more closely, there are several benefits afforded to those who use a cloud-based computing service for their data management, from instantaneous access to their connected storage devices to encryption of their data and information. 
        But there are some downsides to using a cloud-based service, like overall service performance, onsite technical Issues, cyber-threats, service Downtime, and internet Connectivity. 
        When consumers look to pay for a cloud service, cloud computing services offer each of their cloud environments to consumers. 
        Each environment can be very on performance level when dealing with the client’s data requests; this also can be true if the user requires a specific job to be done. 
        To make things smoother for the consumers, cloud distributors are constantly working on ways to provide their service to their consumers in an efficient manner; but the platform model that the distributors built to make the process visually seamless to consumers is not without faults. 
        Just like how all computing services are interconnected to the users through an internet connection, so is a source of power that serves as the driving force behind its every input response and therefore it is prone to the dangers of power outages as well as digital or physical technical issues. 
        In the event of a technical issue, distributors try to handle consumers’ data in a secure fashion. 
        This is because the data stored or passed through the service can pertain to sensitive information of the client. 
        The client’s information, along with other forms of data, is subjectable to outside interception from unauthorized users. 
        Said unauthorized users could potentially gain access to consumers' cloud data by the use of hacking or an unverified device (pretending to be an authorized user). 
        For consumer security, distributes regularly perform diagnostic checks and system maintenance on their cloud servers to optimize their services maximum productivity, on the downside this uptake requires the servers to be taken down or become unavailable for normal consumer use while their technicians work on them. 
        These downtimes can also, unfortunately, come in an unexpected way like power failures (the services facility experience a power outage or a server power failure) or the result of a slowed internet connection to clients due to internet traffic. 
        But despite those drawbacks, consumers choose to use a cloud service because of its main benefit for fast access and location of the consumer’s files and data through a constant 24hr online service. 
        But this is not always perfect, since most providers must keep and maintain an optimal internet connection for client connection to their cloud services. 
        When considering the ways Service Providers try to solve the challenges created by running a cloud computing service, providers could implement information technology to try and solve some of their management overhead. 
        In the field of computer science, recent advancements have been made in the area of computer automation. 
        One said advancement is Artificial Intelligence or AI for short. 
        AI is the unaided response of intelligent actions by an electronic medium (machines, computer programs, handheld devices, desktops/laptops, etc...). 
        The field surrounding the creation of Artificial Intelligence defines it as the creation of an artificial system with intelligence and to allow said system to be capable of perceiving its environment directly, so that the system may take unaided actions in an attempt to directly achieve a predefined goal or outcome. 
        The use of AI technology in our modern society can be applied to every public and private sector. 
        AI technology holds important because it can enable business owners to evolve their reasoning, planning, and perception of how they could handle specific problems that arise in their business; as well as the poetical profit created by the use of AI software at an efficiently low cost. 
        With this recent advancement, a business could be capable of improving their work productivity and learn new ways to improve their productivity. 
        As the modern world moves forward into a more digital era, our technological advancements have allowed humans to experience and learn of new unique ways to tackle issues that were considered so complex to require multiple people and processes to accomplish. 
        With this in mind, companies have started to wonder how they might incorporate the use of artificial intelligence into their own business to poetically increase profit while decreasing the need for human overhead. 
        For most businesses AI regulated systems can be an expensive investment, only large businesses could be capable of handling and sustaining capital while operating their computing structure. 
        This includes the inevitable large amount of capital that is required to construct a proper facility with maintained computer servers that can be subject to access by employees at almost any time of day. 
        Luckily companies today don’t need to solely handle the burden of running a cloud comping facility out of their pocket, they can just outsource their cloud computing requirements to a subscription-based service that will do all the heavy lifting for them. 
        Today companies can allocate funds to pay a designated fee to a cloud service provider in exchange for unlimited use of a portion of their cloud server. 
        This is mostly made in part with the use of human ingenuity and the innovation of Artificial Intelligence. 
        Artificial intelligence in combination with cloud computing can allow a cloud-connected service to give the consumer full extent of their total stored information to be at their disposal with little need to be personally sorted or filtered by someone and in turn, can open up new possibilities for companies to create improved product and service innovations. 
        With the inclusion of AI, tasks can be completed routinely with little to no human intervention. 
        Because an AI tasked with the same job as a human worker can complete its work not only in less time but without the need to double-check its work before submission. 
        Because AI is a computer-based system, it does not need a break and can work indefinitely without signs of fatigue, compared to human workers witch need typically 8-10 hours of allotted work time with breaks every day. 
        While human workers can be at fault by human error, an AI system lasts this fault and makes fewer to no errors. 
        And lastly, AI systems can be used to test new methods of practice to help us to explore different ways of producing the same result. 
        In our modern society, there are currently many jobs and industries held by human workers. 
        But with the rise of more and more advance AI systems, the need for some jobs to need an organic operator is slowly starting to diminish. 
        As of the last decade, artificial intelligence has taken industries like shipping, manufacturing, and business management toward a more automated future. 
        This increase in automation has led to the decrease of human facilitation in our overall workforce because businesses are starting to realize that some of the jobs their workers perform can be done by a computer system with less than half the pay and twice the efficiency. 
        As long as the task is something that can or needs to be repeated hundreds of times, an AI-based interface or system can be used to effectively reduce the business's overall cost and expenses. 
        When taking in the effects of artificial intelligence on the public and private sectors, it is surmised that they both possess similar benefits from their use. 
        Through the utilizing of different AI devices, like chatbots (automated responses with a wide array of predetermined responses) and dynamic work environment management (the automation of the managerial position) that allow for improved and progressively interactive customer service. 
        In the world of business, the rate at which work must be completed is steadily increasing as the years go by. 
        So the industry must learn to adapt and find more effective ways to solve our ever-growing economic demand. 
        In conclusion, the impact of artificial intelligence can be determined to have a great impact on our society in the coming millennia and under the right conditions can lead to a future where it is not only that the mass incorporation of AI hasn’t led to a large jobless and allowed for new hybrid industries with human and AI systems working together. 
        When done inclusively, AI integration can be a tool rather than an obstacle, AI tools can be used to offset the workload from the users to the AI tools and allow its users to be able to manipulate their workload in different ways to increase workflow and allow for better maximization of their workload. 
        As for how the industrial industry will be affected as a whole, the effect of AI integration will have a significant place in our economic system. 
        It is predicted that the future of the industrial system will go through a technological reform, this reform will be unsure in new methods, techniques, advancements, and most of all new industries that will look to capitalize on society's ever-expanding technological needs. 
        With the newly created influxes of capital from the use of AI, a business can then work to either try and reduce their carbon footprint or look to create better infrastructure to allow for more effective delivery of goods and services. 
        With the increasing demand for goods rising, so does the manufacture's desire to lower the maximum cost to manufacture. 
        So for example, if electronic manufactures want to lower costs while increasing their capital, they could do things like invest in new AI-controlled technology or construct a new AI automated facility to make universally used excess parts for their electronics. 
        When looking at the benefits AI could present to our industrial industry, is clear that we, under the right guidance, could use it to create a more effective workforce and relieve the stress of our social system. 
        Not only that but our society and humanity as a whole are driven by the pursuit of knowledge and comfortability. 
        Furthermore, with that pursuit in mind, we must look to strengthen our ability to provide better services to our consumers, so that we can understand and more effectively give support to infrastructure areas that appear to be lacking or not as effective in delivering what it was made to provide us with; whether it be consumer products or medical aid to in-need locations. 
        As our adapting services provide better profit for the business, companies will attempt to expand their ventures and possibly allow for unique job creation that would not have perilously existed otherwise. 
        With the increasing global modernization of the use of computers and other modern electronic devices, the world is moving one step forward to a better planet. 
        So with the future constantly being written and thus being an uncertain path, it is up to our modern society to address and figure out where Artificial Intelligence can be placed in it to be able to reach its maximum technological effect; to help create a better future for those we leave our modern world to.
