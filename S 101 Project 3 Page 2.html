    <h1>Ethical Technology Use</h1>
    <p>Technology, while transformative, can also be used unethically. Here, we explore key ethical issues in the tech world...
       Privacy is the ability and the right to one’s personal information. 
       It is something that is default given to everyone and is used by someone to share, record, backup, and modify information that is personal to themselves or others, like photos, emails, text messages, or computer documents. 
       In modern society, one’s privacy is backed by government-sanctioned privacy laws which help to dictate proper use of privileged information along with passed down social cues in society. 
       It is important because, without it, anyone could access and misuse personal information about one another in ways that could harm them, personally or even physically. 
       I believe that privacy does exist, it is not something that you could ever just get rid of or eradicate. 
       Privacy is a fundamental right that exists on a conceptual level like currency; regardless of the society or culture it always persists. 
       So long as people decide to either uphold their beliefs in personal freedoms or decide that it would be difficult to leave one’s personal information out in the open, we will always have some form of privacy. 
       The way people in our modern world access and manipulate technology can be preserved as both good and bad. 
       For example, social media apps like Facebook could be used to connect separate people directly and indirectly from around the country despite not seeing one another in years. 
       However, following the same example, someone can use Facebook to prescreen someone’s public personal info before making contact. This could lead to potentially hazardous situations. 
       Personal privacy is something that cannot be taken lightly. More specifically, when dealing with privacy, one’s actions can easily lead to their personal information being leaked to others, via the click or tap of a button. </p>
